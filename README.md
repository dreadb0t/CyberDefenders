# 1. L'espion<br>
Category : Threat Intel

According to Crowdstrike, 'Threat intelligence is data that is collected, processed, and analyzed to understand a threat actor’s motives, targets, and attack behaviors. Threat intelligence enables us to make faster, more informed, data-backed security decisions and change their behavior from reactive to proactive in the fight against threat actor.'

In this challenge, a client has asked users to look into the incident and identify the attacker after their network was compromised and taken offline. Currently on the scene and having completed a preliminary investigation are incident responders and digital forensic investigators. Their research demonstrates that the attack was launched from a single user account, most likely an insider.
### Process
We are going to solve this case without using any terminal.
After we downloaded the challange contents, We will be provided a zip file with all the preliminary data that can aid us in our investigation.

After extracting the zip file we can see that there are three files. One of them is a text file named "Github". The name of the other two image files are "Office" and "WebCam".<br>

If we open the file named "Github", we can see that the file contains the URL of an certain Github account.
